# How to play?
Linux environment is required to play the game.  
After downloading `game.out`, enter the following command on a terminal and execute it.
```sh
$ ./game.out
```
You may also compile `main.cpp` by yourself to create the game file.
```sh
$ g++ -o game.out main.cpp
$ ./game.out
```
In doing so, you may rewrite the code in `main.cpp` in any way you like.
